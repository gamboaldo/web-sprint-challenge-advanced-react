# Interview Answers

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
   One has state, and the other doesn't. Stateless components are simple functional components without having a local state
2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?
   componentWillMount is called just before mounting while componentWillUpdate is called just before rendering when new props or state are received by the component
3. Define stateful logic.
   Stateful logic refers to logic operations that affect state. This can be setting or updating state, handling changes or events via helper functions, and logical filters to determine component behavior

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
   The three steps are Arrange (define elements being tested), Act (perform the operation whose result is being tested), Assert (check expected result matches the application)
